# Badge
Badges are inline block elements that often are used on top of or close to another component. They can be used with numbers, text and icons.
A small badge version also exists which does not support slotted content.

## Elevation on white badges
A white badge can easily blend into the background and just appear as a number, icon or not at all if no content is passed. 
Here it can be necesssary to apply some elevation to the badge; this is also done for the examples below where all the badges are displayed on a white background.

The `--kirby-badge-elevation` property can be useful for this. You can see how it is applied to the examples below by inspecting the shared styling for the badge examples:
[badge-example-shared.scss on Github](https://github.com/kirbydesign/designsystem/blob/master/apps/cookbook/src/app/examples/badge-example/examples/badge-example-shared.scss)

export const Template = (args) => ({ props: args });

## Badge with numbers
Using a badge with a number can be a good way to indicate specific status on an element.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default - number"
    args={{
        text: "1"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Success - number"
    args={{
        text: "7",
        themeColor: "success"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Warning - number"
    args={{
        text: "99",
        themeColor: "warning"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Danger - number"
    args={{
        text: "123",
        themeColor: "danger"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Badge with text
Badges can also be used together with a text. Flags might in some cases be a better alternative.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Default - text"
    args={{
        text: "Default"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Success - text"
    args={{
        text: "Success",
        themeColor: "success"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Warning - text"
    args={{
        text: "Warning",
        themeColor: "warning"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="Danger - text"
    args={{
        text: "Danger",
        themeColor: "danger"
      }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={BadgeComponent} />
