    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>kirby-item-sliding</code> element is used to extend the
      <code>kirby-item</code> component with the functionality to reveal buttons when swiped. These
      buttons are created from a list of <code>swipeAction</code> objects which is provided via the
      <code>swipeActions</code> input property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each <code>swipeAction</code> object can be given properties to configure the corresponding
      button with a title, icon, type, disabled status and behaviour when selected.

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <h3>Simple list with swipe actions</h3>
    <p>
      Below is an example of <code>kirby-item-sliding</code> used in a list. Three swipe actions are
      given: save, archive and delete. Each are configured with a title, type and a function to call
      when selected. The delete action is also configured with a icon.

    <h3>Conditional configuration of swipe actions</h3>
    <p>
      This example is an extension of the above "simple list with swipe actions" example; it
      conditionally disables the 'delete' swipe action on a per item basis based on whether it is
      deleteable.
